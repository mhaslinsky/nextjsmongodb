# working with Next JS and MongoDB

first time working with Next JS. Taking advantage of its server side rendering of pages using getStaticProps, getServerSideProps, and getStaticPaths. Also looking into file based routing, API creation with MongoDB and API library built into NextJS. As well as smaller pieces such as the Link and Head components and router hook.
